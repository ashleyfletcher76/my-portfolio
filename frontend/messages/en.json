    "farming": "I grew up working on farms and spent several years in agriculture before moving to Germany in 2019. Those years shaped a lot of my work ethic—long hours, hands-on problem-solving, and staying calm when things don’t go as planned.",

    "42": "Over time, my interests shifted toward tech. I retrained as a software developer and joined 42 Heilbronn, where I learned C, C++, algorithms, and system programming in a peer-driven learning environment.",
    "schwarz": "Most recently, I completed my internship at Schwarz IT, working with Kotlin, Java, TypeScript, Docker, and microservice architectures. It confirmed that software development is exactly where I want to build my career."
